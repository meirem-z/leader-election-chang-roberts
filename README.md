# Distributed Leader Election – Chang–Roberts Algorithm

## Description
This project simulates a distributed leader election algorithm
(Chang–Roberts) in a ring network.

Each node has a unique identifier (ID), and the node with the highest ID
is elected as the leader through message passing.

## Algorithm
- Ring topology
- Chang–Roberts leader election
- Leader = highest ID
- Message cost measured

## How to Run
Install Python 3, then run:

```bash
python main.py
